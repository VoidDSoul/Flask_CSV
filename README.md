# CSV File Upload and Processing Web App

This is a web application that allows users to upload CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, process the data in them, and then download the modified CSV file.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the Flask web server. Run the following command:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the web app.

## How to Use

1. When you open the web app in your browser, you'll see a form where you can select a CSV file to upload. Choose a CSV file and click the "Upload" button.

2. After uploading, the app will process the data in the uploaded CSV file. The sum of the values in the "first_value" and "second_value" columns will be added to a new "sum" column.

3. Once the processing is complete, a download link will appear. You can click the link to download the modified CSV file.

4. If you select a new file, the status message will be cleared and hidden, allowing you to start the process with a fresh file.
